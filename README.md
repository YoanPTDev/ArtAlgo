## Generative.fm

Generative.fm is a unique website that generates endless, ever-evolving ambient music. While not visual art, it can provide inspiration for sound-based generative art projects.

## openFrameworks with C++ and GLSL

openFrameworks is a powerful and flexible creative coding toolkit. When combined with C++ and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), you can create high-performance generative art and real-time interactive installations. It offers low-level access to hardware and graphics, allowing for more sophisticated and optimized visuals.

## Unity with C# and ShaderLab

Unity is a popular game development engine that can also be used for generative art projects. By leveraging C# for scripting and ShaderLab for custom shaders, you can create visually stunning and interactive generative art experiences, both for desktop and virtual reality.

## TouchDesigner

TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming environment that excels in generative art, interactive media, and live visuals. With its real-time capabilities and extensive library of nodes, artists can create complex and dynamic generative art installations.

## Max/MSP

Max/MSP is another visual programming language, well-suited for interactive multimedia projects and generative art. It allows you to create custom patches and connect various modules to generate real-time visuals and audio.

## WebGL

WebGL is a JavaScript API that brings hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to web browsers. It's commonly used with libraries like Three.js or Babylon.js to create impressive web-based generative art and interactive visualizations.

## Python with NumPy and Matplotlib

Python is a versatile programming language with libraries like NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for data visualization. Artists can use these tools to create data-driven generative art and complex mathematical visualizations.

## TensorFlow or PyTorch for Deep Learning Art

If you want to explore generative art through the lens of deep learning and neural networks, TensorFlow or PyTorch can be invaluable tools. Artists have used these frameworks to generate art, create style transfers, and explore the creative potential of AI-generated content.

## Cinder

Cinder is a C++ library for creative coding and is particularly well-suited for visual art projects, interactive installations, and multimedia experiences.

## Blender

Blender is an open-source 3D computer graphics software widely used for modeling, animation, rendering, and more. While it's well-known for its capabilities in 3D animation and visual effects for film and gaming, it's also a powerful tool for generative art.
Blender's Generative Art Capabilities:

1. Procedural Modeling: Blender allows artists to create intricate and complex 3D models using procedural techniques. You can use modifiers, nodes, and Python scripting to generate geometric shapes, patterns, and organic structures algorithmically.

2. Animation Nodes: Blender's Animation Nodes add-on enables the creation of dynamic and animated scenes based on node-based visual scripting. Artists can use this tool to procedurally animate objects, create particle systems, and generate mesmerizing motion graphics.

3. Custom Shaders: Blender has a built-in shader editor that supports creating custom materials using the Shader Editor. This allows artists to design unique materials and textures, perfect for generative art projects.

4. Python Scripting: Blender's Python API allows artists to write custom scripts and add-ons to automate tasks, create complex generative art scenes, and manipulate objects programmatically.

5. Grease Pencil: Blender's Grease Pencil tool allows for 2D drawing and animation directly within the 3D environment. It's an excellent option for artists interested in combining 2D and 3D elements in their generative art.

6. Simulations: Blender includes physics simulations like smoke, fluids, and particles, enabling artists to create dynamic and realistic animations that can be incorporated into generative art projects.

7. Eevee Renderer: Blender's real-time rendering engine, Eevee, offers quick feedback on scenes' lighting, materials, and animations, which is useful for rapidly iterating and experimenting with generative art designs.
